# Speen ~~Game~~

This isn't a game yet, doofus.

## Building

Prerequisites: `SDL2`, `xxd` (optional, usually from `vim`. Set `EMBED_MODEL_FILES`
to false in the Makefile to disable), and [whatever bgfx needs](https://bkaradzic.github.io/bgfx/build.html#linux).

```
git clone --recurse-submodules
make
```
